FIXME: Add a thing explaining tokens

Restricting access to pages
---------------------------

Restricting access to pages can be done in the database:

* To restrict to logged in users only: set the "secure" field to 1.
* To restrict to a particular group of users:

Add code to the "access_php" field in the database that returns "true" if access is granted.

Examples: 
to restrict a page to administrators: access_php = "return hasEquivalentToken ('security', -1);"
to restrict a page to show owners: access_php = "return hasEquivalentToken ('show', 0);"

If (access_php != ""), "secure" is implied. ie. users will be asked to log in before access_php is evaluated.

Restrictions set in place using "secure" and "access_php" propagate to children - for a page to be accessed,
the user must have appropriate tokens to fulfill the requirements of the page they are trying to view and all
of its parents. This should make it easier to add subpages without knocking holes in camdram's security model.

NB.

* These settings restrict who can access your page. You should still check people have permissions to perform any
action on the database before committing that action.
* In previous incarnations of camdram, pages had to individually evaluate their security requirements. Some pages
still do this. Please don't do this in new code; old pages should gradually be moved to having their access requirements
in the database wherever possible. (Apart from anything else, it keeps the menu working.)
